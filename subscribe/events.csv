The Russian imperial capital of St. Petersburg was a major stop during John Philip Sousa’s 1903 tour of Europe.  Sousa planned his St. Petersburg performances to coincide with the tsar’s birthday and the bicentennial of the city’s founding, and anticipated large audiences for these concerts because the band had never before played in Russia.  What resulted, however, was a misadventure.  The concerts occurred at the beginning of Russia’s annual summer vacation when most theaters and concerts halls were closed.  In addition Russian music critics’ responses to his music was tepid.  Sousa was intimidated by the extensive advertising throughout the city for what he initially believed to be his music rival Суза, but eventually discovered that this was the Russian spelling of his own name.   While the St. Petersburg performances were not well attended, the concerts did spark deep patriotism among the American diplomats who were able to attend and the Russian aristocracy and military enthusiastically received the Sousa Band’s renditions of the Imperial Russian and American national anthems.  This exhibit of photographs, music, newspaper reviews, and political cartoons document Russian perceptions of America and Sousa’s music at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.
 
From its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.
On display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University’s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll’s racing chair.
The exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours. Visit the Museum’s website to learn more http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/events/#ui150.

http://calendars.illinois.edu/detail/7?eventId=33287963,“From Russia with Love:” John Garvey’s Russian Folk Orchestra,Exhibition,"Sousa Archives and Center for American Music, 1103 S. Sixth Street, Champaign","Oct 12, 2017 - Sep 3, 2018    All Day ","2017 American Music Month Exhibit
The University of Illinois Russian Folk Orchestra was founded in 1974 by John Garvey, who had joined the University’s Walden String Quartet in 1948 as its violist and in 1959 established the university’s jazz band program.  In 1969, the jazz band toured the Soviet Union as part of the State Department’s cultural exchange program, and Garvey developed a keen interest in Russian folk music.  He later returned to the USSR to study Russian folk music traditions and purchased additional folk instruments that he used to establish the Illinois Russian Folk Orchestra.  The Illinois ensemble eventually served as a model for other American universities’ Russian folk orchestras by providing open depoliticized educational spaces for students to pursue their interest in Russian folk music traditions.  This exhibit of folk instruments, photographs, and music provides visitors with a general introduction to Russian folk music traditions and culture that were promoted by the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the folk musicians who immigrated to the United States after WWII.  It also acknowledges many of the talented musicians who performed with the University of Illinois’ Russian Folk Orchestra under Garvey’s direction between 1974 and 1989 and reveals a forgotten part of the University of Illinois’ musical past.

During the late 1960s many university campuses across America experienced significant political and social turmoil.  For the University of Illinois the spring of 1970 was a time of tremendous political unrest among students and faculty regarding America’s involvement in the Vietnam war, the US Department of Defense’s construction of the Illiac IV supercomputer on campus, the Champaign-Urbana police force’s killing of an unarmed African American student on the Illinois campus, and the Ohio National Guard’s shooting of four students on the campus of Kent State University.   While Illinois’ students and many of its faculty frequently came together at this time to protest the Federal government’s growing political oppression and imperialism, the campus’ activists and protestors used many different music genres to convey their messages across the Urbana-Champaign campus.  Music groups like the Campus Folksong Club, the Walden String Quartet, Medicare 7, 8, or 9, and REO Speedwagon as well as many faculty members from the University’s School of Music frequently lent their musical talents to support these political and social protests.  This exhibit of photographs, news clippings, advertisements, protest broadsides, concert programs, graphic illustrations, and audio recordings highlight the diverse intersections of music, art, and protest on the Illinois campus during the 1970 school year.

http://calendars.illinois.edu/detail/7?eventId=33295730,KAM Exhibition | Basel Abbas + Ruanne Abou-Rahme: And yet my mask is powerful,Exhibition,"Krannert Art Museum Main Level, West Gallery","May 12, 2018   9:00 am   ","Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme make collaborative work informed by the artists’ research with historical archives, literature, underground music, and film. And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists’ book.
The exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich’s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors—seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself—and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich’s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.
Part II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are “hacked” and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists’ multi-layered research process.
Abbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.
Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme’s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, São Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.
