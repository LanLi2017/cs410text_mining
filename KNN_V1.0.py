And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists’ book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich’s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors—seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself—and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich’s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are “hacked” and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists’ multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits.

Mapping of regional carbonate carbon isotope trends identifies isochroneity and diachroneity of unconformity-bound packages of strata (defining chronostratigraphic strike and dip). Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) enables rapid, nondestructive elemental analysis, providing additional insights into facies characterization, local correlation, depositional processes and economic assessment.\nOur work in the basin is currently focused on the Maquoketa Group. Despite an abundance of high-quality subsurface samples, chronostratigraphic study of the Maquoketa Group was little developed. Our work has not only generated a robust chemostratigraphic analysis of most of the available cores in the basin, but uncovered rich graptolite and chitinozoan records and conducted targeted conodont studies that greatly enhance our new chronostratigraphic foundation. These results show that the Maquoketa is highly diachronous through certain parts of the basin, clarifying inconsistent compositional patterns identified by previous studies.\xa0\nChemostratigraphic studies in the Illinois Basin are making tangible improvements to the fundamental understanding of bedrock geology. These new studies provide opportunities for regional collaboration and advancement of multiple initiatives within the basin.\n\xa0\nDownload Flyer: http://isgs.illinois.edu/sites/isgs/files/seminar/ISGS_SeminarFlyer_20180430.pdf\n\xa0\nAbout the speaker\nDr. McLaughlin is an Indiana University research scientist with the Geological and Water Survey and an adjunct professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

However, a profitable online pricing mechanism is essential to build charging stations, and to realize the potential of electric vehicles. We propose an online pricing mechanism for electric vehicle charging. A charging station decides prices for each arriving EV depending on the energy and the time within which the EV will be served (i.e. deadline). The user selects either one of the contracts by paying the prescribed price or rejects all depending on their own valuation. The charging station can serve users using renewable energy and conventional energy. Users may select longer deadlines as they may have to pay less because of the less amount of conventional energy, however, they have to wait a longer period. Finding an optimal menu-based pricing is challenging because the charging station is unaware of the user's valuations. The decision space increases exponentially with the number of users as current user's decision also affects the future users' prices. We consider a myopic charging station where the charging station optimizes only over the current time horizon. We show that when the charging station does not know the utilities of the users, there exists a prior-free pricing strategy which maximizes the social welfare, however, the profit to the charging station is zero. We propose a fixed profit pricing strategy which provides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and can maximize the profit in practice for a wide range of distribution functions. In the final part, I will show that the menu-based pricing mechanism can be extended to the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service. The charging station will add another option of maximum amount of energy to be discharged from the vehicle, and sets price accordingly. The user will select one of the options or rejects all. We show that if the renewable energy generation is low, the users will be more incentivized to participate in the V2G service. We show that the menu-based pricing can decrease the peak energy consumption, and increase the V2G participation of the users.\nBiography: Arnob Ghosh is a post-doctoral research associate since August, 2016 in the Industrial Engineering Department of Purdue University.

Therefore, it is important to understand how to scale these microscale climatological observations to represent the mesoscale.\xa0 A single observing station will represent a limited area around the station, but each individual observation will sample a different physical land area in time due to varying wind speeds, wind direction, and atmospheric stability. The methods and techniques presented in this talk will address the challenges, limitations, and future work that is needed to properly scale and represent microscale processes at the mesoscale in four dimensions for varying ecosystems.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'}, 'IGB Seminar - Computing Genomes for Reproductive Health': {'Url': 'http://calendars.illinois.edu/detail/7?eventId=33291733', 'Title': 'IGB Seminar - Computing Genomes for Reproductive Health', 'Type': 'Seminar/Symposium', 'Location': 'Carl R.

# docdic={'2017 American Music Month Exhibit\nThe Russian imperial capital of St. Petersburg was a major stop during John Philip Sousa’s 1903 tour of Europe.\xa0 Sousa planned his St. Petersburg performances to coincide with the tsar’s birthday and the bicentennial of the city’s founding, and anticipated large audiences for these concerts because the band had never before played in Russia.\xa0 What resulted, however, was a misadventure.\xa0 The concerts occurred at the beginning of Russia’s annual summer vacation when most theaters and concerts halls were closed.\xa0 In addition Russian music critics’ responses to his music was tepid.\xa0 Sousa was intimidated by the extensive advertising throughout the city for what he initially believed to be his music rival Суза, but eventually discovered that this was the Russian spelling of his own name. \xa0\xa0While the St. Petersburg performances were not well attended, the concerts did spark deep patriotism among the American diplomats who were able to attend and the Russian aristocracy and military enthusiastically received the Sousa Band’s renditions of the Imperial Russian and American national anthems.\xa0 This exhibit of photographs, music, newspaper reviews, and political cartoons document Russian perceptions of America and Sousa’s music at the beginning of the twentieth century.\nFor more information, please visit\xa0https://archives.library.illinois.edu/sousa/american-music-month/.\xa0': 'Exhibition', 'The exhibit Knowledge at Work: The University of Illinois at 150 traces the connections between the University of Illinois and people, places, and ideas near and far.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists’ book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich’s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors—seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself—and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich’s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are “hacked” and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists’ multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits.

Mapping of regional carbonate carbon isotope trends identifies isochroneity and diachroneity of unconformity-bound packages of strata (defining chronostratigraphic strike and dip). Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) enables rapid, nondestructive elemental analysis, providing additional insights into facies characterization, local correlation, depositional processes and economic assessment.\nOur work in the basin is currently focused on the Maquoketa Group. Despite an abundance of high-quality subsurface samples, chronostratigraphic study of the Maquoketa Group was little developed. Our work has not only generated a robust chemostratigraphic analysis of most of the available cores in the basin, but uncovered rich graptolite and chitinozoan records and conducted targeted conodont studies that greatly enhance our new chronostratigraphic foundation. These results show that the Maquoketa is highly diachronous through certain parts of the basin, clarifying inconsistent compositional patterns identified by previous studies.\xa0\nChemostratigraphic studies in the Illinois Basin are making tangible improvements to the fundamental understanding of bedrock geology. These new studies provide opportunities for regional collaboration and advancement of multiple initiatives within the basin.\n\xa0\nDownload Flyer: http://isgs.illinois.edu/sites/isgs/files/seminar/ISGS_SeminarFlyer_20180430.pdf\n\xa0\nAbout the speaker\nDr. McLaughlin is an Indiana University research scientist with the Geological and Water Survey and an adjunct professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.

However, a profitable online pricing mechanism is essential to build charging stations, and to realize the potential of electric vehicles. We propose an online pricing mechanism for electric vehicle charging. A charging station decides prices for each arriving EV depending on the energy and the time within which the EV will be served (i.e. deadline). The user selects either one of the contracts by paying the prescribed price or rejects all depending on their own valuation. The charging station can serve users using renewable energy and conventional energy. Users may select longer deadlines as they may have to pay less because of the less amount of conventional energy, however, they have to wait a longer period. Finding an optimal menu-based pricing is challenging because the charging station is unaware of the user's valuations. The decision space increases exponentially with the number of users as current user's decision also affects the future users' prices. We consider a myopic charging station where the charging station optimizes only over the current time horizon. We show that when the charging station does not know the utilities of the users, there exists a prior-free pricing strategy which maximizes the social welfare, however, the profit to the charging station is zero. We propose a fixed profit pricing strategy which provides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and can maximize the profit in practice for a wide range of distribution functions. In the final part, I will show that the menu-based pricing mechanism can be extended to the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service. The charging station will add another option of maximum amount of energy to be discharged from the vehicle, and sets price accordingly. The user will select one of the options or rejects all. We show that if the renewable energy generation is low, the users will be more incentivized to participate in the V2G service. We show that the menu-based pricing can decrease the peak energy consumption, and increase the V2G participation of the users.\nBiography: Arnob Ghosh is a post-doctoral research associate since August, 2016 in the Industrial Engineering Department of Purdue University.

Many of the climatological conditions occurring at the mesoscale are highly influenced by microscale processes. Therefore, it is important to understand how to scale these microscale climatological observations to represent the mesoscale.\xa0 A single observing station will represent a limited area around the station, but each individual observation will sample a different physical land area in time due to varying wind speeds, wind direction, and atmospheric stability.
